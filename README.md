# CursedBot

[![N|Solid](https://i.ibb.co/p4bb52B/Rust-programming-language-black-logo.png)](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

CursedBot is a cursed Discord bot.
## Features

- Sqlite database integration
- Fast & stable
- Examples for lots of Serenity & Poise features
- Commented code for ease of development
- KeepAlive Axum server if you want to run the bot on a free server host like Render

This bot was originally meant for a private server, so some of the commands (XOTD & Roles)
might not make too much sense to use in your own server.

NOTE: /memes command currently borked, will fix in a future update.
